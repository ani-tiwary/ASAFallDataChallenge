# ASAFallDataChallenge
This repository contains the code that our team used for the American Statistical Association's Fall Data Challenge. Our team used Python, Pandas, and Seaborn to create these graphs looking at specific parts of our data.

These are the graphs we made:

![Industries Respondents Worked In](industry.png)
![Languages Respondents Wanted to Work In](want.png)
![Scatter Plot of Salary, Experience, and Language ](scatter.png)
![Scatter Plot of Salary, Experience, and Language Limited to Respondents who know Python and JavaScript ](scatter_python_js.png)
